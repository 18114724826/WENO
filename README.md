# WENO in python

# This repository provides two modules: weno_interp.py and weno_advect.py.
# weno_interp.py showcases how the WENO method can interpolate arbitrary functions
# in smooth and discontinous regions.
# weno_advect.py is an example of an advection code that uses the WENO method to
# give 5-th order convergence at smooth and discontinous regions.
